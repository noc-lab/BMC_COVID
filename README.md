Code for paper "Development and Validation of Predictive Models for COVID-19 Outcomes in a Safety-net Hospital Population". Due to a restrictive data use agreement and HIPAA rules, we do not provide the data or part of the code for data pre-processing.

The LSTM-transformer model was build under Tensorflow 1.15.0.
